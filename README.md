# Python communist revolution

A man once said to abolish the `classes` or something like that. Unfortunately, it is impossible to abolish `class` in python without breaking the language, so we do the next best thing: we consider that all `classes` are born equal[^1].

Use this module to unite all classes, and initiate the global communist revolution[^2]:
```python
import communism

class OurClass1:
    pass
class OurClass2:
    pass
    
communism.revolution(globals())

# As all classes are equal (in __hash__ and in __eq__)
# This is why you cannot put more than one object in any Set or Dict
print(set([OurClass1(), OurClass2(), OurClass2()]))
# >> {<__main__.OurClass1 object at 0x00000235D216E140>}`
```

## Installation

In our terminal:
* `git clone https://github.com/jokteur/python_communism.git`
* `cd python_communism/`
* `pip install .`

Now you have access to communism!

[^1]: Well, not all classes are born equal. It is not possible to do a complete communist revolution without breaking the language. This is why there are elites (like the `__builtins__`) which are more equal than all of the others.

[^2]: The communist revolution does not prevent future `classes` to be equal to all others. `Classes` declared after the `communism.revolution()` will not follow the communism rule.
